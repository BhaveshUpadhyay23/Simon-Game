## 🎮 Introduction

The **Simon Game** is a classic memory challenge where players repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors. This web-based version is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, offering an interactive experience directly in your browser.

Each round adds a new color to the sequence. Your goal is to repeat the sequence correctly. As levels progress, the challenge becomes more difficult. How far can your memory take you?

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Start the Game**  
   Press any key to start (tap **Start** on mobile). 

2. **Watch the Sequence**  
   Observe the order in which the buttons light up.

3. **Repeat the Sequence**  
   Click the buttons in the same order. Each correct input advances you to the next level.

4. **Advance Through Levels**  
   With each level, the sequence becomes longer. Stay focused and keep up.

5. **Game Over**  
   A wrong click ends the game. You can restart and try to beat your previous score.
